The cannibals and missionaries problem is a classic river-crossing puzzle. The task is to transport three missionaries and three cannibals from one side of a river to the other using a boat. The boat can carry at most two individuals, and the number of missionaries on either side must never be outnumbered by cannibals, or the missionaries will be eaten. The challenge is to find a sequence of boat trips that successfully moves all individuals to the other side without violating the rules.
